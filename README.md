# Advent of Code 2022 Java

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.
I used Java 18 for these solutions. Note that these solutions are not optimized for speed or memory
usage. I just solved them the way I know how. But I think they're easy to understand, especially for
a beginner like me :)
